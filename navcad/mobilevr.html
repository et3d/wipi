VR was in the air since 90's with bi-chromatic 3D method and with nowadays cellphones we can use the power of those handful toys plus smart usage of captors.

What we have to do is push a 3D file into a VR compatible format with less points as possible! In my experiments, the Wavefront aka .OBJ works great
